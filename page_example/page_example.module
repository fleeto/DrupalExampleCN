 * Implementation of hook_perm().

 * special permissions, we need to define what those permissions are here.
 * This ensures that they are available to enable on the user role
 * administration pages.

/**
 * Implementation of hook_menu().
 *
 * You must implement hook_menu() to emit items to place in the main menu.
 * This is a required step for modules wishing to display their own pages,
 * because the process of creating the links also tells Drupal what
 * callback function to use for a given URL. The menu items returned
 * here provide this information to the menu system.
 *
 * With the below menu definitions, URLs will be interpreted as follows:
 *
 * If the user accesses http://example.com/?q=foo, then the menu system
 * will first look for a menu item with that path. In this case it will
 * find a match, and execute page_example_foo().
 *
 * If the user accesses http://example.com/?q=bar, no match will be found,
 * and a 404 page will be displayed.
 *
 * If the user accesses http://example.com/?q=bar/baz, the menu system
 * will find a match and execute page_example_baz().
 *
 * If the user accesses http://example.com/?q=bar/baz/1/2, the menu system
 * will first look for bar/baz/1/2. Not finding a match, it will look for
 * bar/baz/1/%. Again not finding a match, it will look for bar/baz/%/2. Yet
 * again not finding a match, it will look for bar/baz/%/%. This time it finds
 * a match, and so will execute page_example_baz(1, 2). Note the parameters
 * being passed; this is a very useful technique.

  // replaced with the corresponding parts of the menu path. In this case a 0
  // would be replaced by 'bar', a 1 by 'baz', and like wise 2 and 3 will be
